# 👋 Hey there, I'm Deekshith Dade

Welcome to my corner of the internet — where Deep Learning meets thoughtful design, and intelligent systems spring to life.

---

### 🧠 Who am I?
I'm a Software Engineer & Researcher with a knack for **building intelligent systems** — be it self-supervised ECG models, agentic EPUB readers, or multi-agent storytellers. Currently doing my Master's at the **University of Utah**, working on **generative and interpretable AI for biomedical signals**.

> I love chasing ideas that blend creativity, engineering, and purpose.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 📚 [Augment: Your AI Thought Partner](https://github.com/Deekshith-Dade/augment)
> _An experimental agentic mind-map engine that helps you make sense of your thinking._
- Built with LangGraph, FastAPI, and React Three Fiber
- Creates persistent embeddings of your ideas
- Visualizes thought clusters in 3D space
- Streaming agent workflows with memory & tools

🎯 _"Claude's Artifacts meets personalized memory graph"_

#### 🧬 [Contrastive ECG Pretraining @ SCI Institute](https://deekshith-dade.github.io/projects/ecg-contrastive)
- Pretrained a **MoCo-style contrastive model** on 1M+ ECGs
- Achieved SOTA AUC with only 10% labeled data
- Built a **PyTorch DDP pipeline** with SLURM & W&B
- Created interpretable generative models using **Latent Diffusion** & **GANs** for ECG explanations

🧪 Also designed U-Net-based signal counterfactuals — AI that speaks clinical language.

#### 📖 [Spot Reader](https://spot-reader.com) ([Code](https://github.com/hunterwr/CS6953Project.git))
> _An AI-enhanced EPUB reading platform with RAG, chat, and annotations._
- Full-stack system: **Next.js + FastAPI + Supabase + AWS S3**
- Multi-tool agents with access to web search, YouTube, Pinecone RAG
- Live streaming responses via FastAPI
- Dockerized backend deployed to AWS EC2 + CI/CD + SSL

🧠 _Reads with you. Thinks with you._

#### 🪧 [Synthetic Data for Road Sign Detection](https://github.com/Deekshith-Dade/synthetic-roadsign-blender)
- Procedurally generated diverse road scenes in **Blender**
- Trained **DETR** and **YOLOv5** using synthetic + real data
- Improved detection IoU by 3%

---

#### 📜 [Long Document Transformers (Reproduced)](https://github.com/Deekshith-Dade/reproduced-efficient-longdoc-classification.git)
- Benchmarked transformer architectures on long document classification

### 🔭 What I’m exploring
- Building AI that can **organize your mind** — Augment-style
- Fine-tuning Diffusion + VQ-VAE for **signal-level generation**
- Multi-agent orchestration with **LangGraph**
- RAG systems that **cite structured graph memory** (Graph-RAG with Neo4j)

### ✨ Closing Thought
> _"If it helps one person think better, it was worth building."_

Thanks for stopping by. Star a repo, drop me a message, or just explore — I’m building things that matter.
