# 👋 Hey there, I'm Deekshith Dade

Welcome to my corner of the internet — where Deep Learning meets thoughtful design, and intelligent systems spring to life.

---

### 🧠 Who am I?
I'm a Software Engineer & Researcher with a knack for **building intelligent systems** — be it self-supervised ECG models, agentic EPUB readers, or multi-agent storytellers. Currently doing my Master's at the **University of Utah**, working on **generative and interpretable AI for biomedical signals**.

> I love chasing ideas that blend creativity, engineering, and purpose.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 📚 [Augment: Your AI Thought Partner](https://augment.deekshith.me) ([Code](https://github.com/Deekshith-Dade/augument-frontend.git))
> _An experimental agentic mind-map engine that helps you make sense of your thinking._
- Built with LangGraph, FastAPI, and React Three Fiber
- Creates persistent embeddings of your ideas
- Visualizes thought clusters in 3D space
- Streaming agent workflows with memory & tools

🧠 _Augment captures your raw thoughts — voice, text, screenshots — embeds them, clusters them by meaning, and maps them in 3D so you can literally see what’s on your mind._

#### 📖 [Spot Reader](https://reader.deekshith.me) 
> _An AI-enhanced EPUB reading platform with RAG, chat, and annotations._
- Full-stack system: **Next.js + FastAPI + Supabase + AWS S3**
- Multi-tool agents with access to web search, YouTube, Pinecone RAG
- Live streaming responses via FastAPI
- Dockerized backend deployed to AWS EC2 + CI/CD + SSL

🧠 _Reads with you. Thinks with you._

### ✨ Closing Thought
> _"If it helps one person think better, it was worth building."_

Thanks for stopping by. Star a repo, drop me a message, or just explore — I’m building things that matter.
